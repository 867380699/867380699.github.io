# ABOUT

Alpine Linux is an independent, non-commercial, general purpose Linux distribution designed for power users who appreciate security, simplicity and resource efficiency.

**SMALL**
Alpine Linux is built around `musl libc` and `busybox`.
A container requires no more than `8 MB` and a minimal installation to disk requires around `130 MB` of storage. 
**SIMPLE**

**SECURE**
