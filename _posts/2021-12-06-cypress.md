# Intro

```js
// Find an element by its selector and retry until it is found in the DOM
cy.get('.awesome-selector')
```

```js
// Find an element in the document containing the text 'New Post'
cy.contains('New Post')
```

When writing a `.click()` command, Cypress ensures that the element:

- Not being hidden
- Not being covered
- Not being disabled
- Not animating

```js
// alias
cy.get('.my-selector')
  .as('myElement') // sets the alias
  .click()

cy.get('@myElement').click()  // re-queries
```

Test without a single explicit assertion:

```js
cy.visit('/home')

cy.get('.main-menu').contains('New Project').click()

cy.get('.title').type('My Awesome Project')

cy.get('form').submit()
```

You never need to write `.should('exist')` after a DOM based command.

`Cypress` bundles `Chai`, `Chai-jQuery`, and `Sinon-Chai` to provide built-in assertions.

`.and()`is another name for `.should()` that makes things more readable:

```js
cy.get('#header a')
  .should('have.class', 'active')
  .and('have.attr', 'href', '/users')
```

# Structure

## Plugins file

The plugins file is a special file that executes in `Node` before the project is loaded, before the browser launches, and during your test execution. 

While the `Cypress` tests execute in the browser, the plugins file runs in the background `Node` process, giving your tests the ability to access the file system and the rest of the operating system by calling the `cy.task()` command.

## Support file

By default Cypress will automatically include the support file `cypress/support/index.js`.

This file runs **before** every single spec file. 

The support file is a great place to put reusable behavior such as `custom commands` or global overrides.

## Writing tests

### Test Structure

`context()` is identical to `describe()` and `specify()` is identical to `it()`

### Hooks

- `before()`
- `beforeEach()`
- `afterEach()`
- `after()`


# intercept

```js
// mock
cy.intercept('/api/users*', {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: getUserList(),
});
```

## webSocket

```js

```
