# Overview

Running these commands to install the packages:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
npm install --save @babel/polyfill
```

Creating a config file named `babel.config.json` in the root of your project with this content:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "edge": "17",
          "firefox": "60",
          "chrome": "67",
          "safari": "11.1",
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
        "corejs": "3.6.4",
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

And running this command to compile all your code from the src directory to lib:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir lib
```

# Presets

Presets, on the other hand, are the combinations of Plugins which help simplify the workflow by avoiding installation of multiple Plugins and worrying about the invokation order.

## Preset Paths
If the preset is on `npm`, you can pass in the name of the preset and babel will check that it's installed in `node_modules`

`'@vue/cli-plugin-babel/preset'` -> `node_modules/@vue/cli-plugin-babel/preset.js`

### relative path

### preset shorthand

`babel-preset-`

```js
{
  "presets": [
    "@org/babel-preset-name",
    "@org/name" // equivalent
  ]
}
```

# polyfill
You can satisfy all Babel feature requirements by using `@babel/polyfill`.
