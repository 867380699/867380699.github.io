`C++` joins three separate programming categories: the procedural language; the object-oriented language; and generic programming.

In general, a class defines what data is used to represent an object and the operations that can be performed on that data.

C++98/C++03
C++11



The Mechanics of Creating a Program

1. write the source code.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Link the object code with additional code.



The file containing the translated program is the object code for your program.

C++ programs normally use libraries.A C++ library contains object code for a collection of computer routines, called functions, to perform tasks such as displaying information onscreen or calculating the square root of a number. Linking combines your object code with object code for the functions you use and with some standard startup code to produce a runtime version of your program. The file containing this final product is called the executable code.

In naming a source file, you must use the proper suffix to identify the file as a C++ file.This not only tells you that the file is C++ source code, it tells the compiler that, too.

The extension you use depends on the C++ implementation.

| C++ Implementation | Source Code Extension(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Unix | C, cc, cxx, c |
| GNU C++ | C, cc, cxx, cpp, c++ |
| Microsoft Visual C++ | cpp, cxx, cc |

Unix Compiling and Linking
In C++, as in C, you can spread a program over more than one file.  In such a case, you can compile a program by listing all the files on the command line, like this:

```bash
CC my.C precious.C
```

This recompiles the **my.C** file and links it with the previously compiled **precious.o** file.

```bash
CC my.C precious.o
```

Linux Compiling and Linking
Linux systems most commonly use g++, the GNU C++ compiler.

```bash
g++ spiffy.cxx
g++ my.cxx precious.cxx
g++ my.cxx precious.o
```

Command-Line Compilers for Windows Command Prompt Mode

An inexpensive route for compiling C++ programs on a Windows PC is to download a free command-line compiler that runs in Windows Command Prompt mode.

Free Windows downloads that include the GNU C++ compiler are `Cygwin` and `MinGW`; they use `g++` as the compiler name.

- Compile typically means compile the code in the file that is currently open.
- Build or Make typically means compile the code for all the source code files in the project. This is often an incremental process.
- Build All typically means compile all the source code files from scratch.


 If your compiler closes the window, you’ll have a hard time seeing the output. To see the output, you must place some additional code at the end of the program:

```c++
cin.get(); // add this statement 
cin.get(); // and maybe this, too 
return 0;
}
```

XCode - Not only does it provide an IDE that supports several programming languages, it also installs a couple of compilers — `g++` and `clang`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  using namespace std; // make definitions visible
  cout << "Come up and C++ me some time.";
  cout << endl; // start a new line
  cout << "You wont't regret it!";
  return 0;
}
```

Seeing `cout` instead of the `printf()` function might come as a minor shock. `C++` can, in fact, use `printf()`, `scanf()`, and all the other standard C input and output functions, provided that you include the usual C `stdio.h` file.

It uses C++’s input facilities, which improve in many ways upon the C versions.

Typically, `main()` is called by startup code that the compiler adds to your program to mediate between the program and the operating system.


If your program is to use the usual C++ input or output facilities, you provide these two lines:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

C++, like C, uses a preprocessor. This is a program that processes a source file before the main compilation takes place. 

```cpp
#include <iostream> // a PREPROCESSOR directive
```
This directive causes the preprocessor to add the contents of the iostream file to your program.

This is a typical preprocessor action: adding or replacing text in the source code before it’s compiled.

In essence, the contents of the iostream file replace the `#include <iostream>` line in the program.

Files such as `iostream` are called include files or header files.

C++ compilers come with many header files, each supporting a particular family of facilities.

Now the `h` extension is reserved for the old C header files (which C++ programs can still use), whereas C++ header files have no extension.

There are also C header files that have been converted to C++ header files. These files have been renamed by dropping the h extension and prefixing the filename with a c. For example, the C++ version of `math.h` is the `cmath` header file.

Header File Naming Conventions

| Kind of Header | Convention | Example | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C++ old style | Ends in `.h` | iostream.h | Usable by C++ programs |
| C old style | Ends in `.h` | math.h | Usable by C and C++ programs |
| C++ new style | No extension | iostream | Usable by C++ programs, uses namespace std |
| Converted C | c prefix, no extension | cmath | Usable by C++ programs, might use non-C features, such as namespace std |

Namespaces
If you use iostream instead of iostream.h, you should use the following namespace directive to make the definitions in iostream available to your program:

```cpp
using namespace std
```

Namespace support is a `C++` feature designed to simplify the writing of large programs and of programs that combine pre-existing code from several vendors and to help organize programs.

```cpp
using std::cout; // make cout available
using std::endl; // make endl available
using std::cin; // make cin available
```

In `C++,` any series of characters enclosed in double quotation marks is called a **character string**.

And what is `cout`? It’s a predefined object that knows how to display a variety of things, including strings, numbers, and individual characters. 

> **A First Look at Operator Overloading**
If you’re coming to C++ from C, you probably noticed that the insertion operator (`<<`) looks just like the bitwise left-shift operator (`<<`). This is an example of operator overloading, by which the same operator symbol can have different meanings.
>C itself has some operator overloading. For example, the `&` symbol represents both the address operator and the bitwise `AND` operator. The `*` symbol represents both multiplication and dereferencing a pointer. The important point here is not the exact function of these operators but that the same symbol can have more than one meaning, with the compiler determining the proper meaning from the context.
>C++ extends the operator overloading concept by letting you redefine operator meanings for the user-defined types called classes.


`endl` is a special C++ notation that represents the important concept of beginning a new line. 

C++ Statements

A C++ program is a collection of functions, and each function is a collection of statements.

```cpp
int carrots;
```
This statement provides two kinds of information: the type of memory storage needed and a label to attach to that storage.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  using namespace std;
  int carrots;
  cout << "How many carrots do you have?" << endl; 
  cin >> carrots;
  cout << "Here are two more. ";
  carrots = carrots + 2;
  cout << "Now you have " << carrots << " carrots." << endl;
  return 0;
}

// How many carrots do you have?
// > 20
// Here are two more. Now you have 22 carrots.
```

```cpp
cin >> carrots;
```
Looking at this statement, you can practically see information flowing from `cin` into `carrots`. 

C++ functions come in two varieties: those with return values and those without them.

C and C++ divide these two features —- prototype and definition —- for library functions. The library files contain the compiled code for the functions, whereas the header files contain the prototypes.
You should place a function prototype ahead of where you first use the function.


Some languages reserve the term function for functions with return values and use the terms procedure or subroutine for those without return values, but C++, like C, uses the term function for both variations.

The function call assigns the value 3 to the n variable defined in the **simon()** header:

```cpp
simon(3);
```


- You can place the `using namespace std;` above the function definitions in a file, making all the contents of the std namespace available to every function in the file.
- You can place the `using namespace std;` in a specific function definition, making all the contents of the std namespace available to that specific function
- Instead of using `using namespace std;` you can place `using std::cout;` in a specific function definition and make a particular element, such as `cout`, available to that function
- using `using std::cout` above function definitions.
- You can omit the using directives and declarations entirely and use the `std::` prefix whenever you use elements from the std namespace: `std::cout << "I’m using cout and endl from the std namespace" << std::endl;`


C++ statement types include the following:
- Declaration statement — A declaration statement announces the name and the type of a variable used in a function.
- Assignment statement — An assignment statement uses the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.
- Message statement — A message statement sends a message to an object, initiating some sort of action.
- Function call — A function call activates a function.When the called function ter- minates, the program returns to the statement in the calling function immediately following the function call.
- Function prototype — A function prototype declares the return type for a function, along with the number and type of arguments the function expects.
- Return statement — A return statement sends a value from a called function back to the calling function.

To store an item of information in a computer, the program must keep track of three fundamental properties:
- Where the information is stored
- What value is kept there
- What kind of information is stored


Names beginning with two underscore characters or with an underscore character followed by an uppercase letter are reserved for use by the implementation—that is, the compiler and the resources it uses. Names beginning with a single underscore character are reserved for use as global identifiers by the implementation.

> In ANSI C, two names that have the same first 63 characters are considered identical, even if the 64th characters differ.

If you want to form a name from two or more words, the usual practice is to separate the words with an underscore character, as in my_onions, or to capitalize the initial character of each word after the first, as in myEyeTooth. (C veterans tend to use the underscore method in the C tradition, whereas those raised in the Pascal tradition prefer the capitalization approach.)

C++’s basic integer types, in order of increasing width, are `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, and, with C++11, `long long`. Each comes in both `signed` and `unsigned` versions.

It would be convenient if each type were always some particular width for all systems — for example, if short were always 16 bits, int were always 32 bits, and so on. But life is not that simple.
No one choice is suitable for all computer designs. C++ offers a flexible standard with some guaranteed minimum sizes, which it takes from C. Here’s what you get:

- A `short` integer is at least 16 bits wide.
- An `int` integer is at least as big as short.
- A `long` integer is at least 32 bits wide and at least as big as int.
- A `long long` integer is at least 64 bits wide and at least as big as long.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

int main() {
  using namespace std;
  
  cout << "int is " << sizeof(int) << " bytes." << endl;
  cout << "short is " << sizeof(short) << " bytes." << endl;
  cout << "long is " << sizeof(long) << " bytes." << endl;
  cout << "long long is " << sizeof(long long) << " bytes." << endl;
  
  cout << endl;

  cout << "Maximum values:" << endl;
  cout << "\tint:" << INT_MAX << endl;
  cout << "\tshort:" << SHRT_MAX << endl;
  cout << "\tlong:" << LONG_MAX << endl;
  cout << "\tlong long:" << LLONG_MAX << endl;

  cout << endl;
  cout << "Bits per byte: " << CHAR_BIT << endl;
  // ...
  return 0;
}
```

Symbolic Constants from `climits`:

| Symbolic | Constant Represents |
| --- | --- |
| CHAR_BIT | Number of bits in a char |
| CHAR_MAX | Maximum char value |
| CHAR_MIN | Minimum char value |
| SCHAR_MAX | Maximum signed char value |
| SCHAR_MIN | Minimum signed char value |
| UCHAR_MAX | Maximum unsigned char value |
| SHRT_MAX | Maximum short value |
| SHRT_MIN | Minimum short value |
| USHRT_MAX | Maximum unsigned short value |
| INT_MAX | Maximum int value |
| INT_MIN | Minimum int value |
| UINT_MAX | Maximum unsigned int value |
| LONG_MAX | Maximum long value |
| LONG_MIN | Minimum long value |
| ULONG_MAX | Maximum unsigned long value |
| LLONG_MAX | Maximum long long value |
| LLONG_MIN | Minimum long long value |
| ULLONG_MAX | Maximum unsigned long long value |

The `climits` file contains lines similar to the following:
```cpp
#define INT_MAX 32767
```
The `#define` directive works like a global search-and-replace command in a text editor or word processor.

However, the #define directive is a C relic. `C++` has a better way of creating symbolic constants (using the `const` keyword), so you won’t be using `#define` much. But some header files, particularly those designed to be used with both C and C++, do use it.

C++ has an initialization syntax that is not shared with C:
```cpp
int owls = 101; // traditional C initialization, sets owls to 101 
int wrens(432); // alternative C++ syntax, set wrens to 432
```

>**Caution**
>If you don’t initialize a variable that is defined inside a function, the variable’s value is indeterminate. That means the value is whatever happened to be sitting at that memory location prior to the creation of the variable.

```cpp
int emus{7}; // set emus to 5, from C++98
int rheas = {12}; // set rheas to 12, C++11


int rocs = {}; // set rocs to 0 
int psychics{}; // set psychics to 0
```

Note that unsigned by itself is short for unsigned int.



`iostream` provides the `dec`, `hex`, and `oct` manipulators to give `cout` the messages to display integers in decimal, hexadecimal, and octal formats, respectively.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int chest = 42;
int waist = 42;
int inseam = 42;
cout << "Monsieur cuts a striking figure!" << endl;
cout << "chest = " << chest << " (decimal for 42)" << endl; 
cout << hex; // manipulator for changing number base
cout << "waist = " << waist << " (hexadecimal for 42)" << endl; 
cout << oct; // manipulator for changing number base
cout << "inseam = " << inseam << " (octal for 42)" << endl; 
return 0;
}
```

Note that code like the following doesn’t display anything onscreen, instead, it changes the way cout displays integers.

```cpp
cout << hex;
```

```cpp
// using cout.put() to display a char constant 
cout.put('!');
```

| Character Name | ASCII Symbol | C++ Code | ASCII Hex Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alert | BEL | `\a` | 0x7 |
| Backspace | BS | `\b` | 0x8 |


```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "\aOperation \"HyperHype\" is now activated!\n";
  cout << "Enter your agent code:________\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b";
  long code;
  cin >> code;
  cout << "\aYou entered " << code << "...\n";
  cout << "\aCode verified! Proceed with Plan Z3!\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Using universal character names is similar to using escape sequences. A universal character name begins either with `\u` or `\U`.The `\u` form is followed by 8 hexadecimal digits, and the `\U` form by 16 hexadecimal digits.These digits represent the **ISO 10646** code point for the character.

```cpp
cout << "Let them eat g\u00E2teau.\n";
// Let them eat gâteau.
```

**The bool Type**
The ANSI/ISO C++ Standard has added a new type (new to `C++`, that is), called `bool`.
In the past, C++, like C, has not had a Boolean type. C++ interprets nonzero values as true and zero values as false.

```cpp
bool is_ready = true;
```

```cpp
const int Months = 12; // Months is symbolic constant for 12
```

Like `ANSI C`, `C++` has three floating-point types: `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

`Significant figures` are the meaningful digits in a number.

In effect, the `C` and `C++` requirements for significant digits amount to `float` being at least 32 bits, `double` being at least 48 bits and certainly no smaller than `float`, and `long double` being at least as big as `double`.

You can look in the `cfloat` or `float.h` header files to find the limits for your system. 

```shell
// dump include path from g++
g++ -E -x c++ - -v < /dev/null 
```

`C++` empowers you to force type conversions explicitly via the type cast mechanism.
you can use either of the following expressions:

```cpp
(long) thorn // straight C
long(thorn) //  pure C++
```

```cpp
cout << int('Q'); // displays the integer code for 'Q'
```

the `static_cast<>` operator, can be used for converting values from one numeric type to another. 

```cpp
bats = (int) 19.99 + (int) 11.99; // old C syntax 
coots = int (19.99) + int (11.99); // new C++ syntax
cout << static_cast<int>(ch) << endl; // using static_cast
```

`auto` Declarations in `C++11`

```cpp
std::vector<double> scores; 
std::vector<double>::iterator pv = scores.begin();
```

C++11 allows you to write this instead:

```cpp
std::vector<double> scores; 
auto pv = scores.begin();
```

# Compound Types

## Array

An **array** is a data form that can hold several values of the same type. 

```cpp
short months[12]; // creates array of 12 short
```

```cpp
int yamcosts[3] = {20, 30, 5}; // create, initialize array
```

If you don’t initialize an array that’s defined inside a **function**, the element values remain **undefined**.That means the element takes on whatever value previously resided at that location in memory.

```cpp
float hotelTips[5] = {5.0, 2.5};
```

If you partially initialize an array, the compiler sets the remaining elements to zero.

```cpp
long totals[500] = {0}; // let the compiler initialize the remaining elements to zero.
```

If you leave the square brackets (`[]`) empty when you initialize an array, the C++ compiler counts the elements for you. 

```cpp
short things[] = {1, 5, 3, 8}; // The compiler makes things an array of four elements.

int num_elements = sizeof things / sizeof (short);

```

### C++11 Array Initialization

First, you can drop the `=` sign when initializing an array:

```cpp
double earnings[4] {1.2e4, 1.6e4, 1.1e4, 1.7e4}; // okay with C++11
```

Second, you can use empty braces to set all the elements to `0`:

```cpp
float balances[100] {}; // all elements set to 0
```

## String
C-style strings have a special feature: The last character of every string is the `null` character.This character, written `\0`, is the character with ASCII code `0`, and it serves to mark the string’s end. 

```cpp
char cat[8] = {'f', 'a', 't', 'e', 's', 's', 'a', '\0'}; // a string!
```

use a quoted string, called a string constant or string literal, as in the following:

```cpp
char fish[] = "Bubbles"; // let the compiler count
```

Quoted strings always include the terminating `null` character implicitly.

Any two string constants separated only by whitespace *(spaces, tabs, and newlines)* are automatically joined into one.

```cpp
cout << "I'd give my right ar"
"m to be a great violinist.\n";
// I'd give my right arm to be a great violinist.
```

The cin technique is to use whitespace — spaces, tabs, and newlines - to delineate a string.

```cpp
// Reading String Input a Line at a Time
cin.getline(name, 20); // reads no more than 19 characters, leaving room to the null 
```

`get()` leaves newline in the input queue. 

```cpp
cin.get(name, ArSize); // read first line
cin.get(); // read newline
cin.get(dessert, Arsize); // read second line
```

`getline()` is a little simpler to use, but `get()` makes error checking simpler *(check if get() return newline)*.

```cpp
int year;
cin >> year;
cin.get(); // the newline generated by the Enter key in the input queue
cout << "What is its street address?\n"; 
char address[80];
cin.getline(address, 80);
```

`string` Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string> 

int main() {
  using namespace std;
  string str1;
  string str2 = "panther";
  cin >> str1; // str1 resized to fit input
  cout << str2;
  cout << "The third letter in " << str2 << " is "<< str2[2] << endl; // use array notation
}
```

Using a `string` object both more convenient and safer than using an array.

C++11 String Initialization

```cpp
char first_date[] = {"Le Chapon Dodu"}; 
char second_date[] {"The Elegant Plate"}; 
string third_date = {"The Bread Bowl"}; 
string fourth_date {"Hank's Fine Eats"};
```

The `string` class makes some operations simpler than is the case for arrays.

```cpp
string str1;
string str2 = "panther";
str1 = str2; // Assignment
string str3;
str3 = str1 + str2; // Concatenation

int len1 = str1.size();
```

with character arrays:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  using namespace std;
  char charr1[20] = "penguin";
  char charr2[20];
  strcpy(charr2, charr1);
  char charr3[20] = "buzzard";
  strcat(charr3, charr2);
  cout << charr1 << " " << charr2 << " " << charr3 << endl;
  // penguin penguin buzzardpenguin
  int len = strlen(charr1);
  return 0;
}
```

```cpp
cin.getline(charr, 20);
getline(cin,str);
```

C++11

```cpp
wchar_t title[] = L"Chief Astrogator"; // w_char string 
char16_t name[] = u"Felonia Ripova"; // char_16 string 
char32_t car[] = U"Humber Super Snipe"; // char_32 string

string stru = u8"你好"; // UTF-8

cout << R"(Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl.)" << '\n'; // raw string
// Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl.

// place additional characters between the opening " and (
// the default delimiters of "( and )" have been replaced with "+*( and )+*".
cout << R"+*("(Who wouldn't?)", she whispered.)+*" << endl;
// "(Who wouldn't?)", she whispered.
```

```bash
# with c++11
g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp
```

## Structure

structure declaration:
```cpp
struct inflatable {
  char name[20]; 
  float volume; 
  double price;
};
```

Each individual item in the list is called a structure member。

```cpp
struct inflatable goose; // keyword struct required in C 
inflatable vincent; // keyword struct not required in C++
```

```cpp
inflatable guest = {
  "Glorious Gloria", // name value 
  1.88, // volume value 
  29.99 // price value
}; // guest is a structure variable of type inflatable
```

C++11 Structure Initialization

empty braces result in the individual members being set to `0`. 

```cpp
// C++11, The = sign is optional
inflatable mayor {}; //  mayor.volume and mayor.price being set to 0
// and all the bytes in mayor.name being set to 0:
```

---

Also you can use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign one structure to another of the same type. Doing so causes each member of one structure to be set to the value of the corresponding member in the other structure, even if the member is an array. This kind of assignment is called `memberwise assignment`.

You can combine the definition of a structure form with the creation of structure variables.

```cpp
struct perks {
  int key_number;
  char car[12];
} mr_smith, ms_jones; // two perks variables
```

Another thing you can do with structures is create a structure with no type name.

```cpp
struct // no tag 
{
  int x; // 2 members
  int y;
} position; // a structure variable
```

initializing an array of structs:

```cpp
inflatable guests[2] = {
  {"Bambi", 0.5, 21.99}, // first structure in array
  {"Godzilla", 2000, 565.99} // next structure in array 
};
```

Bit Fields in Structures

`C++`, like `C`, enables you to specify structure members that occupy a particular number of bits. This can be handy for creating a data structure that corresponds, say, to a register on some hardware device.

```cpp
struct torgle_register {
unsigned int SN : 4; // 4 bits for SN value
unsigned int : 4; // 4 bits unused
bool goodIn : 1; // valid input (1 bit)
bool goodTorgle : 1; // successful torgling
};
```

Bit fields are typically used in low-level programming. 

## Union
A union is a data format that can hold different data types but only one type at a time.

That is, whereas a structure can hold, say, an `int` **and** a `long` **and** a `double`, a union can hold an `int` **or** a `long` **or** a `double`.

```cpp
union one4all {
  int int_val;
  long long_val; 
  double double_val;
};
```

```cpp
one4all pail; 
pail.int_val = 15; // store an int
cout << pail.int_val; 
pail.double_val = 1.38; // store a double, int value is lost 
cout << pail.double_val;
```

The size of the union is the size of its largest member.

```cpp
struct widget {
  char brand[20]; 
  int type; 
  union id {
    long id_num;
    char id_char;
  } id_val;
};
// ...
widget prize;
// ...
if (prize.type == 1)
  cin >> prize.id_val.id_num;
else
  cin >> prize.id_val.id_char;
```

An `anonymous union` has no name; in essence, its members become variables that share the same address. Naturally, only one member can be current at a time:

```cpp
struct widget {
  char brand[20]; 
  int type; 
  union // anonymous union
  {
    long id_num; // type 1 widgets
    char id_char[20]; // other widgets
  };
}; 
// ...
widget prize;
// ...
if (prize.type == 1)
  cin >> prize.id_num; 
else
  cin >> prize.id_char;
```

Because the union is anonymous, **id_num** and **id_char** are treated as two members of prize that share the same address.

## Enumeration
The C++ enum facility provides an alternative to const for creating symbolic constants.

```cpp
enum spectrum {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, indigo};
```


This statement does two things:

- It makes spectrum the name of a new type; spectrum is termed an enumeration,
much as a struct variable is called a structure.
- It establishes red, orange, yellow, and so on, as symbolic constants for the integer values `0–7`.These constants are called enumerators.

By default, enumerators are assigned integer values starting with `0`. You can override the default by explicitly assigning integer values.

```cpp
spectrum band = blue;
```

Only the assignment operator is defined for enumerations. In particular, arithmetic operations are not defined:

```cpp
band = orange; // valid
++band; // not valid
band = orange + red; // not valid
```

However, some implementations do not honor this restriction.

Enumerators are of integer type and can be promoted to type int, but int types are not converted automatically to the enumeration type:

```cpp
int color = blue; // valid, spectrum type promoted to int
band = 3; // invalid, int not converted to spectrum
color = 3 + red; // valid, red converted to int
```

Again, some implementations do not enforce this restriction. 

You can set enumerator values explicitly by using the assignment operator:

```cpp
enum bits{one = 1, two = 2, four = 4, eight = 8};
```

The assigned values must be integers.

You also can define just some of the enumerators explicitly:

```cpp
enum bigstep{first, second = 100, third};
// third would have the value 101.
```

You can create more than one enumerator with the same value:

```cpp
enum {zero, null = 0, one, numero_uno = 1};
```

Originally, the only valid values for an enumeration were those named in the declaration. However, `C++` has expanded the list of valid values that can be assigned to an enumeration variable through the use of a type cast. Each enumeration has a range, and you can assign any integer value in the range, even if it’s not an enumerator value, by using a type cast to an enumeration variable.

```cpp
enum bits{one = 1, two = 2, four = 4, eight = 8}; 
bits myflag;
myflag = bits(6); // valid, because 6 is in bits range
```

The range is defined as follows.

```cpp
// ...
max_value = max(enum_values);
upper = 2 ^ 0;
while (upper < max_value) {
  upper = upper ^ 2;
}
upper = upper -1; // 127 etc.

min_value = min(enum_values);
if (min_value >= 0) {
  lower = 0;
} else {
  lower = - 2 ^ 0;
  while (lower > min_value) {
    lower = lower ^ 2;
  }
  lower = lower + 1; // -127 etc.
}
```

The idea is that the compiler can choose how much space to use to hold an enumeration.

C++11 extends enumerations with a form called the `scoped enumeration`. 

## Pointer
Three fundamental properties of which a computer program must keep track when it stores data.

- Where the information is stored
- What value is kept there
- What kind of information is stored


```cpp
// one strategy for accomplishing these ends
int val = 1;
```

You just apply the address operator, represented by `&`, to a variable to get its location.

> Pointers and the C++ Philosophy
Object-oriented programming differs from traditional procedural programming in that OOP emphasizes making decisions during runtime instead of during compile time. 

TYhe name of the `pointer` represents the location. Applying the `*` operator, called the `indirect value` or the `dereferencing` operator, yields the value at the location.

```cpp
int * p_updates;
```

We say that *p_updates* points to type int. We also say that the type for *p_updates* is pointer-to-int or, more concisely,`int *`.

Traditionally, C programmers have used this form:
```c
int *ptr;
```
This accentuates the idea that the combination `*ptr` is a type int value. Many C++ programmers, on the other hand, use this form:
```cpp
int* ptr;
```
This emphasizes the idea that `int*` is a type, pointer-to-int.
