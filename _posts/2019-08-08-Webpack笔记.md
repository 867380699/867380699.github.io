# Get Start

```bash
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

> <https://webpack.js.org/>

# Concepts

## Entry
An **entry point** indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal **dependency graph**. 

By default its value is `./src/index.js`

## Output
The **output** property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files.

## Resolve
```js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    // configuration options
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
    },
  },
};

```

## Loaders
Out of the box, webpack only understands `JavaScript` and `JSON` files. Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Plugins
Perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.

## Mode
By setting the mode parameter to either `development`, `production` or `none`, you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment. The **default** value is `production`.

## Stats
```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  stats: 'verbose'
};

```

## Browser Compatibility
webpack supports all browsers that are `ES5-compliant` (IE8 and below are not supported). webpack needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a **polyfill** before using these expressions.

# webpack.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

```bash
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

# Debugging

```bash
npm install --global node-nightly
# Now, we'll need to run it once to finish the installation
node-nightly 
# break on the first statement of the script
node-nightly --inspect-brk ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

# Bootstrap
```
node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

`node_modules/webpack-cli/bin/cli.js`:
```js
const runCLI = require('../lib/bootstrap');
// ...
runCLI(rawArgs);
```

`node_modules/webpack-cli/lib/bootstrap.js`:
```js
const WebpackCLI = require('./webpack-cli');
const cli = new WebpackCLI();
const result = await cli.run(parsedArgsOpts, core);
```

`node_modules/webpack-cli/lib/webpack-cli.js`
```js
createCompiler(options) {
  compiler = webpack(options);
}
const compiler = this.createCompiler(this.compilerConfiguration);
compiler.run((error, stats) => {});
```

`node_modules/webpack/lib/index.js`
`node_modules/webpack/lib/webpack.js`
`node_modules/webpack/lib/Compiler.js`

```js
run(callback) {
  const run = () => {
    this.compile(onCompiled);
  };
  run();
}
```


# Loaders
A loader is a node module that exports a function. This function is called when a resource should be transformed by this loader. The given function will have access to the Loader API using the `this` context provided to it.

When a single loader is applied to the resource, the loader is called with only one parameter -- **a string containing the content of the resource file**.

The loader is expected to give back one or two values. The first value is a resulting JavaScript code as `string` or `buffer`. The second optional value is a SourceMap as JavaScript object.

> When multiple loaders are chained, it is important to remember that they are executed in **reverse** order -- either right to left or bottom to top depending on array format.

# Plugins

A webpack plugin is a JavaScript object that has an `apply` method.

```js
const pluginName = 'ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin';

class ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.run.tap(pluginName, compilation => {
      console.log('The webpack build process is starting!!!');
    });
  }
}

module.exports = ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin;
```

## SplitChunksPlugin

## Compiler Hooks
### Watching
The Compiler supports `watching` which monitors the file system and recompiles as files change. 

### Hooks

lifecycle hooks are exposed by the `compiler` and can be accessed as such:

```js
compiler.hooks.someHook.tap('MyPlugin', (params) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

Depending on the hook type, `tapAsync` and `tapPromise` may also be available.

### Tapable

> https://github.com/webpack/tapable

The best practice is to expose all hooks of a class in a `hooks` property:

```js
class Car {
	constructor() {
		this.hooks = {
			accelerate: new SyncHook(["newSpeed"]),
			brake: new SyncHook(),
			calculateRoutes: new AsyncParallelHook(["source", "target", "routesList"])
		};
	}
}
```

Other people can now use these hooks:

```js
const myCar = new Car();
// It's required to pass a name to identify the plugin/reason.
myCar.hooks.brake.tap("WarningLampPlugin", () => warningLamp.on());
```

The class declaring these hooks need to call them:

```js
this.hooks.accelerate.call(newSpeed);
this.hooks.calculateRoutes.promise(source, target, routesList).then((res) => {});
this.hooks.calculateRoutes.callAsync(source, target, routesList, err => {});
```

Hook types:

Basic, `Waterfall`, `Bail`, `Loop`

Additionally, hooks can be synchronous or asynchronous.

`Sync`, `AsyncSeries`, `AsyncParallel`

Hook interface:

```js
interface Hook {
	tap: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) => Result) => void,
	tapAsync: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args, callback: (err, result: Result) => void) => void) => void,
	tapPromise: (name: string | Tap, fn: (context?, ...args) => Promise<Result>) => void,
	intercept: (interceptor: HookInterceptor) => void
}

interface Tap {
	name: string,
	type: string
	fn: Function,
	stage: number,
	context: boolean,
	before?: string | Array
}
```
