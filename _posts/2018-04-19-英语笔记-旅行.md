# 语法
## 现在完成时
使用现在完成时，谈论对现在有特定影响的一个过去的动作或事件，例如，**检查某人是否做了某事**。

**Have you packed** your bags? *- 你收拾好了么？*

**Have you printed** your boarding pass. *- 你打印登机牌了么？*

构成现在完成时疑问句的方式： `have + subject + 过去分词`。

以下是一些有用的过去分词。 那它们和现在时及过去式对比。

| 现在时 | 过去式 | 过去分词 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pack | packed | **packed** |
| print | printed | **printed** |
| book | booked | **booked** |
| bring | brought | **brought** |
| lose | lost | **lost** |

如果有人问你是否做了某事，你可以这样回答：

*A:* Have you printed your boarding pass?
*B:* Yes, I have.

*A:* Have you packed your bags?
*B:* No, not yet.

要表达做了什么，用类似这样的短语：

I **have booked** a taxi.

在口语中，代名词和动词通常缩写。

**I've booked** a taxi.

要告诉某人没做什么，使用 `haven't`。

I haven't printed my borading pass.

I haven't checked in yet.

## have to
可以使用 `have to + 动词` 表达必须要做的事情。

Amy's flight leaves in an hour. She'll have to catch the express train. *- Amy 的航班一小时后起飞，她必须赶特快列车。*

The company gave me a limousine, so I didn't have to take the shuttle. *- 公司给我派了一辆豪华汽车，所以我不必乘坐大巴。*

也可以使用 `have to + 动词` 表达有义务要做的事情。

*A:* Did you have to drive Ted to the airport? *- 你必须开车送Ted去机场么？*
*B:* Yes, I did. He drove me last time. *- 是的，我得送他，上次他开车送的我。*

> 记住，在口语中，单词的每个音素并非始终发音。尤其是元音常常缩略或省略。这些形式在书面英语中并不使用，但听到的使用要能够辨认，这非常重要。 口语中， Have to 听起来像 hafta，Has to 听起来像 hasta，Had to 听起来像 hadta 。

## 更多过去分词
有些不规则动词的过去分词和过去时形式不同。

| 现在时 | 过去式 | 过去分词 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| be | was/were | **been** |
| come | came | come |
| do | did | done |
| get | got | gotten/got |
| give | gave | given |
| go | went | gone |
| see | saw | seen |
| take | took | taken |

记住用这些过去分词构成现在完成时，同时记住，谈论发生在过去某个不确定的事件的事情时，使用现在完成时。

肯定陈述
have + 过去分词

否定陈述
haven't + 过去分词

疑问句
Have + 主语 + 过去分词 + ？

## 现在完成时使用的副词
用副词 `yet`，`already`，`never` 和 `even` 在现在完成时中表示过去知道现在的一段时间。

### yet
用副词 `yet` 表示某事尚未发生，或询问某事是否已经发生。该副词场放于句尾。

I haven't printed my boarding pass yet.

They haven't packed their bags yet. *- 他们还没有收拾好行李。*

Has she left for the airport yet? *- 她已经出发去机场了么？*

### Already
使用副词 `already` 来表达某事已经发生，或询问某事是否已经发生。该副词常直接放在主要动词之前。

You can't come? But I've already booked the tickets! *- 你不来了吗？ 可是我机票都定好了！*

Carly has already been to Paris, but I haven't. *- Carly 已经去过巴黎了，但是我还没去过。*

Has John already been to the Louvre. *- John 已经去过卢浮宫了。*

### Never & ever
用副词 `ever` 询问是否有事情发生，或谈论某人的经历。 作为否定的回应，用 `never`，这类副词常常放在主要动词前面。

*A:* Have you ever lived in another country?
*B:* No, I've never lived in another country.

*语言提示：* 一个普遍的错误是在肯定句中使用副词 `ever`。



# 询问和告知航班信息
使用类似表达询问航班信息：

*A:* When are you leaving? *- 你什么时候离开？*
*B:* On the 23th. 

*A:* When are you returning? *- 你什么时候回来？*

# 提出不同选择
如果想要获有关抵达某个目的地的交通工具选择的帮助，可以使用类似下面的问题：

Excuse me, how do I get downtown. *- 对不起，请问我怎么去市中心？*

I need to get to the Grand Hotel. What's the best way to go there?

可能会听到提供一些选择的回答：

You can take the shuttle, or you can take a taxi. *- 你可以坐机场大巴，也可以乘坐出租车。*

You could take the express train or the subway.

如果你想询问更多其他选择的问题，或者获得建议，可以询问类似下面的问题：

Would a taxi be expensive?

What do you suggest?

Do I have any other choice?

一旦确认了交通工具，你可能想知道在哪里乘坐：

Where is the subway station from here?
