# 语法

## some & any

在肯定句中使用 `some`。

We have **some** fresh oysters today.

I'll have **some** water. _- 我要来点水。_

也可以使用 `some` 进行请求或提供。

Can I have **some** water, please?

Would you like **some** bread?

当你不能肯定是否得到某样东西时，在问题中用 `any`。

Do you have **any** fresh oysters this evening? _- 你们今晚供应新鲜生蚝吗？_

在否定句中使用 `any` 表示您没有某物。

## 可数名词和不可数名词
**大多数名词都是可数的**，比如 apple 和 steak。这些可数名词都有复数形式，词尾通常是 `s`。

one apple, two apple**s**.

有些名词不能这样计数，比如 soup 和 milk。要加以计数，必须添加像 `a cup of` 或 `two liters of` 这样的短语。

a cup of soup, two cups of soup.

大多数量词要么与可数名词搭配使用，要么与不可数名词搭配使用。`A lot of` 是一个例外，你可以用它搭配可数和不可数名词。

Is there **a lot of** bacon in the soup. *- 汤里面熏猪肉多吗？*

### 搭配可数名词的量词

使用 `a few` 搭配可数名词，谈论数量很少的东西。

使用 `many` 搭配可数名词的复数形式，谈论很大的数量，或与否定形式连用，谈论很小的数量。

They have **many** different kinds of cream. *- 他们有许多不同种类的冰淇淋。*

There aren't **many** strawberries in this fruit salad. *- 这份水果沙拉里草莓很少。*

使用 `how many` 询问可数名词的数量。

**How many** sausages would you like? *- 你要多少香肠？*

### 搭配不可数名词的量词

使用 `a little` 搭配不可数名词，谈论数量很少的东西。

The soup has **a little** sour cream on top. *- 汤上面有点酸奶油。*

Would you like **a little** milk with your coffee? *- 你的咖啡要加点牛奶吗？* 

在否定陈述句中使用 `much` 搭配不可数名词，谈论很少的数量。

I don't  want **much** milk, Just a little, please.

使用 `how much` 询问不可数名词的数量。

**How much** bread would you like?



# 预定餐馆
