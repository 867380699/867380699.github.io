# Basic routing
Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

```js
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
```

# Serving static files

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the `express.static` built-in middleware function in Express.

```js
express.static(root, [options])
```

To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static middleware function multiple times:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('files'))
```

If you run the express app from another directory, it’s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve:
```js
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```
