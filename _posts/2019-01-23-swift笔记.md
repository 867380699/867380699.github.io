Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

- Variables are always initialized before use.
- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
- Integers are checked for overflow.
- Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
- Memory is managed automatically.
- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.


# Simple Values
Use `let` to make a constant and `var` to make a variable. 

A constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it. However, you don’t always have to write the type explicitly.

```swift
let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70
```
include values in strings: Write the value in parentheses, and write a backslash (\) before the parentheses. 

```swift
let apples = 3
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
```

Use three double quotation marks (`"""`) for strings that take up multiple lines. 

```swift
let quotation = """
Even though there's whitespace to the left,
the actual lines aren't indented.
"""
```

Create arrays and dictionaries using brackets (`[]`), and access their elements by writing the index or key in brackets. 

```swift
var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips"]
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"

var occupations = [
    "Malcolm": "Captain",
    "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
```

To create an empty array or dictionary, use the initializer syntax.

```swift
let emptyArray = [String]()
let emptyDictionary = [String: Float]()
```

# Control Flow
Use `if` and `switch` to make conditionals, and use `for-in`, `while`, and `repeat-while` to make loops. Parentheses around the condition or loop variable are **optional**. Braces around the body are **required**.

```swift
let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
var teamScore = 0
for score in individualScores {
    if score > 50 {
        teamScore += 3
    } else {
        teamScore += 1
    }
}
print(teamScore)
// Prints "11"
```

In an if statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expression—this means that code such as `if score { ... }` is an error, not an implicit comparison to zero.

```swift
var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed"
var greeting = "Hello!"
if let name = optionalName {
    greeting = "Hello, \(name)"
}
```

Another way to handle optional values is to provide a default value using the `??` operator. If the optional value is missing, the default value is used instead.

```swift
let nickName: String? = nil
let fullName: String = "John Appleseed"
let informalGreeting = "Hi \(nickName ?? fullName)"
```

Switches support any kind of data and a wide variety of comparison operations—they aren’t limited to integers and tests for equality.

```swift
let vegetable = "red pepper"
switch vegetable {
case "celery":
    print("Add some raisins and make ants on a log.")
case "cucumber", "watercress":
    print("That would make a good tea sandwich.")
case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"):
    print("Is it a spicy \(x)?")
default:
    print("Everything tastes good in soup.")
}
// Prints "Is it a spicy red pepper?"
```

After executing the code inside the switch case that matched, the program exits from the switch statement. 
Execution doesn’t continue to the next case, so there is no need to explicitly break out of the switch at the end of each case’s code.


Use `for-in` to iterate over items in a dictionary by providing a pair of names to use for each key-value pair. Dictionaries are an unordered collection, so their keys and values are iterated over in an arbitrary order.
```swift
let interestingNumbers = [
    "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13],
    "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25],
]
var largest = 0
for (kind, numbers) in interestingNumbers {
    for number in numbers {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number
        }
    }
}
print(largest)
// Prints "25"
```

Use `while` to repeat a block of code until a condition changes. The condition of a loop can be at the end instead, ensuring that the loop is run at least once.



```swift
var n = 2
while n < 100 {
    n *= 2
}
print(n)
// Prints "128"

var m = 2
repeat {
    m *= 2
} while m < 100
print(m)
// Prints "128"
```

# Functions and Closures

Use func to declare a function. Call a function by following its name with a list of arguments in parentheses. Use `->` to separate the parameter names and types from the function’s return type.

```swift
func greet(person: String, day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet(person: "Bob", day: "Tuesday")
```

By default, functions use their parameter names as labels for their arguments. Write a custom argument label before the parameter name, or write `_` to use no argument label.

```swift
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet("John", on: "Wednesday")
```

Use a tuple to make a compound value—for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.

```swift
func calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) {
    var min = scores[0]
    var max = scores[0]
    var sum = 0

    for score in scores {
        if score > max {
            max = score
        } else if score < min {
            min = score
        }
        sum += score
    }

    return (min, max, sum)
}
let statistics = calculateStatistics(scores: [5, 3, 100, 3, 9])
print(statistics.sum)
// Prints "120"
print(statistics.2)
// Prints "120"
```

Functions can be nested.

Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.

A function can take another function as one of its arguments.

```swift
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -> Bool) -> Bool {
    for item in list {
        if condition(item) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
func lessThanTen(number: Int) -> Bool {
    return number < 10
}
var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)
```

Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later.

You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). Use `in` to separate the arguments and return type from the body.


```swift
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in
    let result = 3 * number
    return result
})
```

You have several options for writing closures more concisely. 
When a closure’s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both.
Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.

```swift
let mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })
print(mappedNumbers)
// Prints "[60, 57, 21, 36]"
```

You can refer to parameters by number instead of by name—this approach is especially useful in very short closures. 

A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. 

When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.

```swift
let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { $0 > $1 }
print(sortedNumbers)
// Prints "[20, 19, 12, 7]"
```

# Objects and Classes
Use `class` followed by the class’s name to create a class.

```swift
class Shape {
    var numberOfSides = 0
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
}
```
Create an instance of a class by putting parentheses after the class name. Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance.

```swift
var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()
```
This version of the Shape class is missing something important: an initializer to set up the class when an instance is created. Use `init` to create one.

```swift
class NamedShape {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

Use `deinit` to create a deinitializer if you need to perform some cleanup before the object is deallocated.

Subclasses include their superclass name after their class name, separated by a colon. 

Methods on a subclass that override the superclass’s implementation are marked with `override`—overriding a method by accident, without `override`, is detected by the compiler as an error. The compiler also detects methods with override that don’t actually `override` any method in the superclass.

```swift
class Square: NamedShape {
    var sideLength: Double

    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
        self.sideLength = sideLength
        super.init(name: name)
        numberOfSides = 4
    }

    func area() -> Double {
        return sideLength * sideLength
    }

    override func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A square with sides of length \(sideLength)."
    }
}
let test = Square(sideLength: 5.2, name: "my test square")
test.area()
test.simpleDescription()
```

In addition to simple properties that are stored, properties can have a getter and a setter.

```swift
class EquilateralTriangle: NamedShape {

    var perimeter: Double {
        get {
            return 3.0 * sideLength
        }
        set {
            sideLength = newValue / 3.0
        }
    }

}
```

In the setter for perimeter, the new value has the implicit name `newValue`. You can provide an explicit name in parentheses after set.

If you don’t need to compute the property but still need to provide code that is run before and after setting a new value, use `willSet` and `didSet`. The code you provide is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer.


When working with optional values, you can write `?` before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the `?` is `nil`, everything after the `?` is ignored and the value of the whole expression is `nil`.

```swift
let sideLength = optionalSquare?.sideLength
```

# Enumerations and Structures
Use `enum` to create an enumeration. Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them.

Use `struct` to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

# Protocols and Extensions
Use `protocol` to declare a protocol.

```swift
protocol ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String { get }
    mutating func adjust()
}
```

Classes, enumerations, and structs can all adopt protocols.

Use extension to add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties. You can use an extension to add protocol conformance to a type that is declared elsewhere, or even to a type that you imported from a library or framework.

```swift
extension Int: ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String {
        return "The number \(self)"
    }
    mutating func adjust() {
        self += 42
    }
}
print(7.simpleDescription)
// Prints "The number 7"
```
