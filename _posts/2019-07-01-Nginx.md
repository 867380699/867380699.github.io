```shell
# start nginx
nginx
# Use an alternative configuration file
nginx -c <config-file>
```

```shell
nginx -s <signal>
```

Where signal may be one of the following:

- stop — fast shutdown
- quit — graceful shutdown
- reload — reloading the configuration file
- reopen — reopening the log files

# Configuration File’s Structure
nginx consists of modules which are controlled by directives specified in the configuration file. Directives are divided into **simple directives** and **block directives**. 
A simple directive consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (`;`). 
A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional instructions surrounded by braces (`{` and `}`). 

If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: `events`, `http`, `server`, and `location`).

Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the `main` context. The `events` and `http` directives reside in the `main` context, `server` in `http`, and `location` in `server`.

The rest of a line after the `#` sign is considered a comment.

```config
events {
  # ...
}

http {
  server {
    location {
      # ...
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

# Serving Static Content

Generally, the configuration file may include several `server` blocks distinguished by **ports** on which they listen to and by **server names**.

Once nginx decides which `server` processes a request, it tests the URI specified in the request’s header against the parameters of the `location` directives defined inside the `server` block.

If there are several matching `location` blocks, nginx selects the one with the longest prefix.

```
data
├── images
│   └── image1.png
└── www
    └── index.html
```

```config
http {
  server {
    location / {
      root /data/www;
    }
    location /images/ {
      root /data;
    }
  }
}
```

# Setting Up a Simple Proxy Server

```config
server {
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
  }

  location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png)$ {
    root /data/images;
  }
}
```

A regular expression should be preceded with `~`.
