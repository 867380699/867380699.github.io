### Power
- x1 cards are limited to 0.5 A at +12 V (6 W) and 10 W combined.
- x4 and wider cards are limited to 2.1 A at +12 V (25 W) and 25 W combined.
- A full-sized x1 card may draw up to the 25 W limits after initialization and software configuration as a "high power device".
- A full-sized x16 graphics card may draw up to 5.5 A at +12 V (66 W) and 75 W combined after initialization and software configuration as a "high power device".

Optional connectors add 75 W (6-pin) or 150 W (8-pin) of +12 V power for up to 300 W total (2x75 W + 1x150 W).

| | Transfer speed |
| --- | --- |
| USB 2.0 | 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s) |
| USB 3.x Gen 1| 5Gbit/s (625MB/s) |
| USB 3.x Gen 2 | 10Gbit/s (1.25GB/s) | 
| USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 | 20 Gbit/s (2.5G/s) |

`USB 3.1`, released in July 2013 has two variants. The first one preserves USB 3.0's `SuperSpeed` transfer mode and is labeled `USB 3.1 Gen 1`, and the second version introduces a new `SuperSpeed+` transfer mode under the label of `USB 3.1 Gen 2`. SuperSpeed+ doubles the maximum data signaling rate to `10 Gbit/s`.

USB 3.2, released in September 2017,preserves existing USB 3.1 `SuperSpeed` and `SuperSpeed+` data modes but introduces two new SuperSpeed+ transfer modes over the `USB-C` connector with data rates of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (1.25 and 2.5 GB/s).
