Think of Blueprints as a container for content:

- They can hold Components
- They can hold scripts, but dont't have to
- They can hold ONLY data

Different types of Blueprints:

- Level Blueprints
- Actor Blueprints
- Animation Blueprints
- Widget Blueprints for UI with Unreal Motion Graphics
- Child Blueprints gives us the ability to inherit functionality from a parent Blueprint
