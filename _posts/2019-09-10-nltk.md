# Hello World

```py
import nltk
from collections import Counter

with open('Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone.txt') as f:
  hp = f.read()

tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(hp)
tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

c = Counter()

nnps = list(filter(lambda t:t[1] in ['NNP', 'NNPS'], tagged))

for t in nnps:
  c[t] += 1

c.most_common(20)
```

- tokenizing - word tokenizers, sentence tokenizers
- corpora - body of text. ex: medical journals, presidential speeches
- lexicon - words and their means


# Stop Words

```py
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
words = [w for w in tokens if not w in stop_words]
```

# Stemming

```py
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

ps = PorterStemmer()
words = list(map(lambda w: ps.stem(w), tokens))
```
