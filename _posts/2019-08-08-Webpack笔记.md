# Get Start

```bash
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

> <https://webpack.js.org/>

# Concepts

## Entry
An **entry point** indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal **dependency graph**. 

By default its value is `./src/index.js`

## Output
The **output** property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files.

## Loaders
Out of the box, webpack only understands `JavaScript` and `JSON` files. Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Plugins
Perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.

## Mode
By setting the mode parameter to either `development`, `production` or `none`, you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment. The **default** value is `production`.

## Browser Compatibility
webpack supports all browsers that are `ES5-compliant` (IE8 and below are not supported). webpack needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a **polyfill** before using these expressions.

# webpack.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

```bash
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

# Plugins

A webpack plugin is a JavaScript object that has an `apply` method.

```js
const pluginName = 'ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin';

class ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.run.tap(pluginName, compilation => {
      console.log('The webpack build process is starting!!!');
    });
  }
}

module.exports = ConsoleLogOnBuildWebpackPlugin;
```
