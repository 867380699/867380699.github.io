BitTorrent (`BT`) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (`P2P`).

Torrenting may sometimes be limited by Internet Service Providers (`ISP`s), on legal or copyright grounds.

# Torrent File

These files contain `metadata` about the files to be shared and the `tracker`s which keep track of the other seeds and peers.



# Trackers

Tracker is a necessary role in BT download, it can effectively improve BT download speed.

# Magnet URI
a de facto standard for identifying files (URN) by their content, via cryptographic hash value rather than by their location.

Magnet URIs consist of a series of one or more parameters.

| Params | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dn | Display Name | |
| xt | eXact Topic | URN containing file hash |
| tr | address TRacker | Tracker URL | 


## xt
xt parameter specifies the `URN` for a given `p2p` protocol.

BitTorrent info hash (`BTIH`)

`xt=urn:btih:[ BitTorrent Info Hash ]`

ED2K

`xt=urn:ed2k:[ ED2K Hash ]`

SHA-1

`xt=urn:sha1:[ SHA-1 HASH ]`

MD5

`xt=urn:md5:[ MD5 Hash ]`
